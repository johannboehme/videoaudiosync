/**
 * Backend-agnostic snapshot of one renderable frame.
 *
 * Pure data — no React, no DOM, no `<video>` references. Backends consume
 * this descriptor + a runtime `SourcesMap` (layerId → GPU-importable
 * source) and produce pixels. Same shape drives:
 *   - the live preview compositor (Canvas2D / WebGL2 / WebGPU backends)
 *   - the export compositor (Canvas2D backend)
 *
 * Cuts vs FX semantic split is structural here:
 *   - `layers` come from `activeCamAt` — exclusive (V2: 0 or 1 entries)
 *   - `fx` come from `activeFxAt` — polyphonic, paint additively
 * A backend cannot conflate the two by mistake; they live in different
 * fields. See [memory: P-FX vs Cuts Semantik].
